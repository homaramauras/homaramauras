## 👋 Hello! I'm Homar A. Maurás Rodríguez (@homaramauras)

🎓 I'm a recent graduate of Georgetown University's Master of International Development Policy program, passionate about using data to inform policy and social change.  

🗺️ My main interests lie in **GIS applications**, **impact evaluation**, and **experimental research design** for international development — especially across Latin America & the Caribbean, MENA, and Southeast Asia.  

🧪 I’m currently exploring **spatial regression modeling**, predictive analytics, and integrating remote sensing into program evaluation workflows.  

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects at the intersection of **data science**, **policy**, and **global development**.  

📫 Reach me at: **homaramauras@gmail.com**  
😄 Pronouns: **They/Them**  
🦖 Fun fact: I *love* dinosaurs — and yes, I have a favorite (it's the Stegosaurus).

🔍 Selected tools & languages:
